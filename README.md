**Quick Recipe Chatbot**

**Overview**
The Quick Recipe Chatbot is a web-based application that helps users quickly find recipes based on the ingredients they have available. The chatbot takes user input in the form of ingredients or dish names and provides a list of recipes with preparation steps. The chatbotâ€™s intuitive interface makes it easy for users to interact and receive recipe suggestions in real-time.
